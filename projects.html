          <h4>M9sweeper</h4>
          <p>M9sweeper is the first project I was put on when I started working at intelletive.
            It is a service provided to secure kubernetes servers. The thought process behind the 
            project is that there are a lot of companies running their websites on kubernetes
            servers but not a lot of them have the right security protocols. Our goal
            is to sell our product to companies running on kubernetes servers and make it easy for 
            them to run security tests and fix their vulnerabilities. I was in charge of creating 
            the user interface for the companies to copy commands to their clipboards and run them,
            then take those results from a databse, display them, and tell the companies
            where their vulnerabilities are and how to fix them.

            <h4>Sequenza/Tekumo Pro</h4>
            <p>
              Another project I have worked on at Intelletive is Sequenza/Tekumo Pro. This project
              started off as sequenza and has since been rebranded. It is a service that
              connects technitians with companies that need some sort of service done. An example
              of this would be connecting target with technitians that can install self checkouts.
              Currently I am working on taking the existing website and integrating an accounting 
              pacakge into it to make billing and invoicing a smoother process for Tekumo. Currently
              the company is using excel spreadsheets to keep track of their accounts, and this will be
              a big upgrade for them.
