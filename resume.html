                  I started at Intelletive in June of 2021. I started by gaining a foundation in HTML and SCSS 
                  and spent about a month learning angular and building my own project that was a school
                  registration website. After that, I started working on out internal project called M9sweeper.
                  I was tasked with fixing offshore CSS and it took me about a week to refactor a page so that 
                  all boxes lined up accordingly. Next, I moved over to Tekumo Pro where I am currently integrating 
                  the NetSuite accounting package into our existing invoicing service.

                <p>
                  I started doordashing in the spring of 2019. Since then I have completed over 1,100 sucessful 
                deliveries with a customer satisfaction rating of 4.95/5. I started it as a side hustle and 
                when we had to go home for the pandemic I doordashed every night for someting to do. Even with a part time 
                job, I still choose to doordash as it is a good way to make money and get caught up on my facorite
                podcasts.

                  For the summer of 2019, I managed a team of about 20 lifeguards at Brackett's crossing 
                  country club. I made their schedules, supervised them, and constructed in services to keep their
                  skills sharp. During this time, I also coached the country club swim team. I had about 30 kids
                  on the team and I ran poractices and meets for the team.
