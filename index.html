            <p>My name is Grant Toenges. I am currently a senior at <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/">the University of St Thomas</a> 
              Majoring in <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/academics/undergraduate/computer-science-major-and-minor/">Computer Science</a>. 
              I graduated from <a href="https://rhs.district196.org/">Rosemount High School</a> in 2018. In high school I swam
              for all 4 yers and was captain of the swim team my senior year. I also set the school record in the 100 butterfly 
              at a time of 51.50. I was also a mathlete and played baseball my freshman year. </p>

              <p>This Website is a personal profile for my senior capstone class. It is meant to highlight the projects I have done in my 4 years 
                at UST and my abilities as a programmer.

            <p>In college I started on the biology/pre-med track. I quickly found out that was not for me after my first
              chemistry class. I switched majors to computer science and have loved every second of it. I decided to go out for the 
              swim team my sophomore year and had great success setting 3 new personal best times.

              For the first 3 years of college I worked as a lifeguard and drove doordash to make extra money on the side.
              I worked at <a href="https://www.tcc-club.com/">Town and country club</a> right next to campus for a short time too 
              as a banquet server. Summer before senior year I got an internship at <a href="https://www.intelletive.com/">Intelletive.</a>
              It is a small software consulting firm and I am an intern there doing web development.
