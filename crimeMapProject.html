          <h3>St. Paul Crime Data Map</h3>
            <div class="grid-x margin-right-20">
              <p>This project was for a web development class. We were tasked with creating a website with a dynamic map that showed different crimes in the 
                St. Paul area. We would show a map that seperated St. Paul into different neighborhoods and if you clicked on the neighborhood there would be a 
                widget that poppe up and displayed the name of the neighborhood and how many crimes were committed in that neighborhood. There was a table under the 
                map that displayed all crimes that were in view of the map. if one of these was selected, the map would pan into the spot the crime was committed 
                and give the user more information about that particular crime. This project was done in JavaScript and challenged me to solve poroblems I had 
                not dealt with before and honed in my problem solving skills when it came to coding in JavaScript. This process of problem solving has 
                come in very handy when running into problems with mobile development.
